# MLohr's Basic Widgets with extended Polylang Support

This plugin adds some more Polylang support to basic widgets like Tag Cloud, Categories and Recent Posts.

## Current features of this plugin:

### Widgets with fixated languages

This plugin add the widgets *Categories - Fixed Target Language*,
*Recent Posts - Fixed Target Language* and *Tag Cloud - Fixed Target Language*.
Polylang currently supports only listing categories (and also recent posts and tags)
for the current active language. This plugin re-creates the mentioned

**Example:** With these widgets it's possible to show your english tags
even if you are on a german page on your blog.
